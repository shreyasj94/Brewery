# Brewery

Here I interact with an Open API located at https://www.openbrewerydb.org/. This API contains a database of Breweries within the United States.

I have used the API to create a front-end application were you can perform the belowntasks:
- Create a List of Breweries
- Allows for the search of breweries by Name
- Returns a brewery when there is a match

You can search for breweries using this link https://shreyasj94.github.io/Brewery/
